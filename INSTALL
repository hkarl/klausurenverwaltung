INSTALL notes
-------------

For OSX
-------

- python, sufficiently new (used 2.7.2 in development); must be in path

- install pip:
$ sudo easy_install pip

 (easy_install comes with python)

(leaving out virtualenv on account of lacking experience on my part...)

- install django

$ sudo pip install Django

IMPORTANT: make sure to install ab 1.4.x Django. The code does not work with Django 1.5!
(if necessary, install from here: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/ and follow instructions) 

- install django-select2

$ sudo pip install django_select2

- highly recommended: install GIT  - http://git-scm.com/download/mac
 (standard MAC installation practice; should be easy to install on Linux as well)


- install pdftk: http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/

(it should be installed in /usr/local/bin, if not, we have to adapt p


- in terminal, go to a path where you'D like the web application to live. E.g., ~/bin

- clone the git repository:
$ git clone git://github.com/hkarl/klausurenverwaltung.git

(this is read-only, talk to Holger if you want write-access to the repository as well)

- change into the newly created directory
$ cd klausurenverwaltung

- check that pdftk is in the right place:
$ which pdftk

It should print: /usr/local/bin/pdftk

if not, change the pdftk entry in file klausurenverwaltung/settings.py (at the very end)


- syncrhonize the database and create a master user for it:

$ python manage.py syncdb

(answer the question appropriately, think of a username and a secure password! don't forget the password!)


- start the web application:

$ python manage.py runserver

this will only allow access from the local machine. For world-wide access, run it as:

$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

(listening on port 8000, might need corresponding rule in firewall to allow access)

- log in as master user and create "normal" accounts , possibly restricting access rights

- with webbrowser, open 127.0.0.1:8000
- login in with account /password just created
- Click on Benutzer -> Hinzuf√ºgen
- Add name and password for standard user
- in the following page, add other inofmration and - important!
-- set the "Redakteur" flag !
-- add ONLY the Berechtigungen that start with "klausurensammlung" (mark them in the list at the end, and push them to
the right with the right arrow; click "Sichern" )
(if you trust that user not to create chaos, feel free to add the other Berechtigungen a
 as well - your choice! )


- to generate the PDF files, you need a reasonably new LaTeX installation, e.g. TeXLive 2011
(2010 probably works as well). Sometimes, the exam package is too old; simply updated
 this file if necessary.


TODO: make this work under an apache installation!!
